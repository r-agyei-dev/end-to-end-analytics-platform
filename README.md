## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete exploratory data analysis (EDA) workflow that progresses from raw data inspection to an interactive dashboard for dynamic visualization and filtering.

The analysis includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Feature engineering  
- Statistical exploration and grouped analysis  
- Evaluation of relationships between budget, revenue, and ratings  
- Engineering of financial metrics such as **Profit** and **Return on Investment (ROI)**  
- Development of a regression model for revenue estimation  
- Creation of an interactive analytical dashboard  

The utility of this analytical framework is demonstrated using a **movie analytics dataset**, showing how the workflow can be applied to real-world data to extract insights and build predictive models.

This notebook is organized to reflect professional data science workflow standards commonly used in research labs, analytics teams, and production environments.
